## Overview
OANN's embrace of _Trumpism_ during then-US President Donald Trump's term earned it viewership with the president himself, on April 24 2019, Trump tweeted that former CIA analyst Larry Johnson had accused the United Kingdom's intelligence agencies of “helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign.” This revived a discredited conspiracy theory originally promoted on Fox News in 2017. <sup>[mm](https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/citing-far-right-outlet-oann-trump-revives-conspiracy-theory-caused-international), [tw](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1121006942502182913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)</sup>

## Funding
OANN is funded by advertising, both online and on TV and radio.

## Scoring
OANN routinely fabricates and exagerates stories to political ends:
> In June 2020, OANN claimed without evidence that an elderly protester who had been seriously injured by police "was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers" and was linked to the antifa movement. <sup>[tw](https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1270335685514403840)</sup> Referencing OANN's unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump later tweeted that the protester "could be an ANTIFA provocateur."

Jack Posobiec, notably a promoter of the Pizzagate conspiracy, has advanced other conspiracies while a host at OAN.

During May of 2020, Kristian Rouz working for OAN, claimed "mounting evidence of a globalist conspiracy" involving the Clintons, Soros, Bill Gates, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the Chinese government. Rouz also compiled the wholly fabricated story OANN ran in 2017 alleging that Hillary Clinton's political action committee secretly gave $800,000 to "antifa." She has previosuly worked as a volunteer political cartoonist for the Trump campaign. <sup>[cr](https://www.chanelrion.com/homepage)</sup>

OANN regularly uses hostile language towards its political opponents, and does not publish stories critical to its messaging. As such, it earns a `7` in social bias. However, OANN does publish politically neutral reporting, and reporting on non-political topics, lowering the messaging score to `8`.

OANN sometimes conceals authorship, crediting many articles as coming from the "OAN Newsroom." At other times, authors are listed without links to other work or bio. This results in a `2` in editorial transparency.
