## Overview
_CrimethInc._ is a decentralized, anarchist collective that publishes long-form journalism from a libertarian-left or anarchist perspective. CrimethInc. emerged in the mid-1990s, initially as the hardcore zine Inside Front, and began operating as a collective in 1996. It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarchist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication. We rate CrimethInc. left biased based on their political opposition to capitalism and advocacy for workers. These political positions are considered left wing in today’s political environment. CWC does use occasional emotional language, but all information is well sourced and linked to facts.
