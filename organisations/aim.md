## Overview
AIM is a media watchdog organisation and news media publisher. Founded in 1969 by Reed Irvine, described by his son Don as a “a die-hard anti-communist”, the organisation aimed to counter the perceived liberal bias in media.

## Funding
At least eight separate oil companies are known to have been contributors in the early 80s. Only three donors are given by name: the Allied Educational Foundation (founded and chaired by George Barasch), Shelby Cullom Davis, and billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Scaife gave $2.2 million to Accuracy in Media between 1977 and 1998. AIM has also been funded by Exxon.

## Scoring
AIM's institutional objective is to promote right-wing causes in media, and this is readily reflected in story selection and rhetorical content, earning it a `10` in messaging consistency.

AIM rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, and as such earns a `3` in pseudoscience.

AIM supported the Iraq War and accused the media of bias against the Iraq War in 2007, and alleged bias in mainstream media's coverage of the 2012 Benghazi attack. In 2008, AIM asserted "Waterboarding Is Not Torture" in a sub-heading. The article said that Guantanamo Bay detainees "are enjoying hotel living conditions" and that torture is what "left-wingers associate with anything that makes an accused terrorist uncomfortable". These among other inform their political bias rating. Support for the Iraq War may be considered _neoconservative_.

AIM sometimes attributes articles anonymously, and bylines are not easily searchable or discoverable. Author bios are seldom available, earning it a `6` in editorial transparency.
