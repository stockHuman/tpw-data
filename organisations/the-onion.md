## Overview
The Onion is an American satirical news organisation, publishing print (formerly _The Onion Newspaper_, collected print editions as books), radio, video (mock broadcasts, short form content on social media) and online articles.

The Onion spawned, and was formerly the owner of ClickHole, a click-bait and cheap social media site satirizing similar sites such as BuzzFeed and Upworthy. The Onion still operates _The A.V. Club_, which unlike other sister sites, is not satirical.

The Onion has enjoyed great prominence in online culture and recognition for its humor and social commentary. _['No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27No_Way_To_Prevent_This,%27_Says_Only_Nation_Where_This_Regularly_Happens)_, odd horoscopes, "News in Photos" photoshopped images without article bodies, and editorial cartoons are highly recognizable as The Onion's work. Prominent organisations or media figures mistaking Onion content is for truth often becomes a story itself.

## Funding
The Onion is advertiser funded and runs a branded merch store online.

In 2016, Univision Communications purchased a controlling stake in the company, making it another property under the same umbrella as the Gizmodo Media Group. Like GMG, The Onion and its spinoff were sold to private equity firm _Great Hill Partners_ in 2019 for an undisclosed amount.

## Scoring
The site and individual articles have been repeatedly cliamed by right-wing media as being left-leaning or even explicitly leftist.

Leftist political commentator Emmett Rensin supported the idea of the apparent left-wing bias<sup>[1](https://newrepublic.com/article/116479/onion-americas-finest-marxist-news-source)</sup> with:

> But only one is breathing new life into a far-left movement mostly vanished since FDR dropped dead. It isn't _The Socialist Worker_. It's not _The Militant_, either. And it isn't _Monthly Review_, _Political Affairs_, _World Socialist Website_, or _Worker's Vanguard_. Rather, the vanguard of revolution—the paper most dedicated to the overthrowing capitalism in the United States today—is none other than _The Onion_.

He claimed the bias is an unintentional byproduct of staff writers' need to appeal to a broad base with intuitive premises like Commodity fetishism.

The Onion does not, however, advocate for explicit political positions, and indeed lampoons politicians and political events of every sort. It is however not as focused on a political perspective as other satire sites like [The Babylon Bee](/the-babylon-bee). As such, it ears a `-1` in social bias.

Most articles have no byline, and all are obviously uncited, corresponding to a `3` in editorial transparency.
