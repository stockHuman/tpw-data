## Overview
Wikipedia is a massive, multi-language website that uses the "wiki model" of collaborative editing to create encyclopedic entries. Wikipedia relies on citation concensus from external sources to establish factual claims, and discourages original research, even from experts.

## Funding
Wikipedia is funded through individual donations made to the WikiMedia Foundation.

## Scoring
Articles on the site have no attribution, but individual pseudoanonymous editors and their contributions are listed in a linked history page, as well as a _talk_ page that displays editorial conversations between contributors.

The size, scope and rapidly updated nature of Wikipedia makes a sourcing rating unrealistic. The editorial transparency score, given anonymous edits, corresponds to a three.
