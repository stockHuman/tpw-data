## Overview
VDare is a website that exists primarily to promote an American anti-immigration message. It's widely regarded as a white-supremacist website, and has published white supremacists.

## Funding
VDare solicits donations via the VDARE Foundation and cryptocurrencies, the latter of which at the time of writing have a valuation in excess of USD300,000.<sup>[vdare](archive.is/https://vdare.com/donate), [btc](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3N1azzevDjZSjorCdLaQgBCBXZzGm7ku5R)</sup>

In February 2020, the VDARE Foundation purchased the Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage, a Medieval-style castle located on a hill above Berkeley Springs in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, for USD1.4 million.

## Scoring
VDare publishes content attributed to pen names to obfuscate associations with white supremacists. Content sometimes cites reputable sources, though only when it confirms their narrative, and more self-references other VDare content.

"Racial science", <sup>[1](http://archive.li/Ovaqv)</sup> among other things, informs the rating of pseudoscience.

Promotion of GRT corresponds to a conspiracy of `8`.<sup>[2](https://www.mediamatters.org/vdare/youtube-protected-vdare-which-now-calling-secessionist-ethnostate)</sup>
