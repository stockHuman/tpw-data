## Overview

The Unz Review is [Ron Unz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Unz)'s article aggregator.

The site notably hosts digitized copies of many English publications, dating back more than a century.<sup>[1](https://www.unz.com/print/)</sup>

## Funding

The website does not display ads, but offers a Patreon subscription, earning ~US1620 per month.

## Scoring

The Unz Review, either through Unz himself<sup>[2](https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/) [3](https://spectator.us/topic/ron-unz/)</sup> or through contributors<sup>[4]()</sup>, has promoted Holocaust denial<sup>[5](https://www.unz.com/ldinh/juden-uber-alles/)</sup>, white supremacism and other dangerous conspiratorial material. As such, it earns an automatic `10` in conspiracy.

Promotion of _HBD_, the contemporary euphemism for _scientific racism_ or _racialism_ and anti-vax rhetoric earns it a `4`, if only for its relative infrequency.

Bylines allow for anonymous publishing, and never include author bio, but are filterable by author. Anonymous publishing is infrequent, corresponding to a `6` in editorial transparency.

The Unz review will host content from authors that hold a variety of political views (CJ Hopkins for instance, despite being listed in the footer, denies the association<sup>[cf](https://consentfactory.org/2017/11/03/whos-afraid-of-corporate-cointelpro/)</sup> despite his work being featured) when it conforms to the review's overall political messaging. Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Ilana Mercer can be found re-published on Unz.

Unz himself been the financial supporter and promoter of an ideologically diverse lists of causes. He has been a financial backer of [Counterpunch](/counterpunch)<sup>[form 990, 2012](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/207181582/2013_11_PF%2F20-7181582_990PF_201212)</sup> and Mondoweiss, an explicitly left-wing, anti-Israel publication. In 2016 he gave $2,000 to the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with Unz stating he agreed with Sandersâ€™ anti-interventionist foreign policy views despite other reservations. Unz has twice ran as a Republican for statewide office in California, the first time spending $2 million of his own money on an unsuccessful 1994 Republican primary race to unseat Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in a primary.
