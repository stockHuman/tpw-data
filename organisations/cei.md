## Overview
Founded by Fred L. Smith, Jr., the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a non-profit, libertarian think tank that seeks to advance economic liberty by fighting excessive government regulation because it believes that a free marketplace that allows entrepreneurship and innovation to thrive is better policy. The current President and CEO is Kent Lassman.

## Funding
CEI is a nonprofit that is funded through donations. Up until 2006 Exxon-Mobil donated 2 million dollars to the CEI. The CEI does not disclose donors, however they are funded heavily by the Bradley Foundation and the Koch Family as well as numerous gas/oil companies such as Amoco and Texaco.<sup>[1](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute)</sup>

## Scoring
In review, the CEI promotes environmental policies based on limited government regulation and property rights and rejects what they call “global warming alarmism”. Headlines and articles typically contain emotional loaded language that favors the right such as this Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions. This story comes from the questionable climate change denial website RealClimateScience. When not promoting climate change pseudoscience, they advocate for Libertarian positions such as small government and property rights. 

Editorially, the primary purpose of the CEI is to mislead on climate change. They have been criticized by scientist for publishing misleading information such as this: Scientist to CEI: You Used My Research To “Confuse and Mislead”. According to Ballotpedia the “CEI believes that scientific consensus on climate change and global warming were politically rather than scientifically motivated.” Finally, the CEI has a long history of lobbying for the tobacco industry and since 2011 has advocated for the e-cigarette industry.

Overall, we rate the Competitive Enterprise Institute Questionable based on far right bias, promotion of propaganda, use of poor sources, lack of transparency with funding,

CEI's frequent rejection of scientific consensus regarding climate change earns it a 5 in pseudoscience. All articles related to the topic either avoid the issue or deny claims outright.

CEI publishes author name with extensive linked bio and lists all editorial staff, earning it a `10` in editorial transparency.
