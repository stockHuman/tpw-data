## Overview
Right Wing Watch is a watchdog organisation dedicated to cataloguing and exposing right-wing media, persons, politicians and political campaigns. _People For the American_ Way was hosted on this URL until late 2008, where the RWW branding first appeared, coexisting with _PFWA_ branding for some time.<sup>[wb](https://web.archive.org/web/20080913155256/http://www.rightwingwatch.org/)</sup>

Jared Holt, a _Right Wing Watch_ researcher, was credited for getting conservative radio show host Alex Jones's [InfoWars](/info-wars) program removed from multiple content distribution sites including Apple, Inc., YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify.

## Funding
_(PFWA)_ is Norman Lear's 501(c)(4) non-profit that operates Right Wing Watch, which is evident in the site's branding subtitle.

Major donors to PFAW include George Soros' Open Society Institute, the Miriam G. and Ira D. Wallach Foundation, the Bauman Family Foundation, and the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund.

## Scoring
Story content is, as implied in the title, entirely targeted at the right wing, particularly the American Republican party and associated groups. As such, ideological bias, messaging consistency and social bias are all informed by such a stated purpose.
