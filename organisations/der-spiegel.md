## Overview
_Der Spiegel_ is a German weekly news magazine published in Hamburg. It is one of Europe's largest publications of its kind, with a weekly circulation of more than one million. Founded in 1947 by John Challenor, a British army officer, and Rudolf Augstein, a former Wehrmacht radio operator, it launched an online presence as "Spiegel Online". That version launched on October 25th, 1994, making it the first established publication to do so.

Der Spiegel is known in German-speaking countries mostly for its investigative journalism. It played a key role in uncovering many political scandals such as the "Spiegel" scandal in 1962 and the Flick affair in the 1980s. According to "The Economist", "Der Spiegel" is one of continental Europe's most influential magazines.

A special 25 March 2008 edition of Der Spiegel on Islam was banned in Egypt in April 2008 for publishing material deemed by authorities to be insulting Islam and the Prophet Muhammed.

Der Spiegel has a minor [English publication](https://www.spiegel.de/international/), which launched in 2004.

## Funding
Spegel-Verlag is privately owned and the publication is visibly advertiser funded; the magazine has a content to advertising ratio of approximately 2:1.

## Scoring
In 2018, former reporter Claas-Hendrik Relotius was [fired](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46666389) for embezzelment and [fabricating details](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/der-spiegel-reporter-fake-stories-claas-relotius-journalist-made-interviews-fabricated-a8692006.html) within news items. This necessarily lowers the sourcing score to a `7`, with consideration that the publication has filed criminal charges against him and investigated his stories since, and is otherwise reputable.

Der Spiegel earns a `9` in editorial transparency as some reporters in the masthead do not contain neither links nor bio.
