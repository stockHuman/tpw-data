## Overview
Zero Hedge is a far-right leaning, libertarian finance analysis and news blog. In its formative years, the blog was praised for its early assessments of high frequency trading and corruptive forces in the banking industry.

In March of 2011, Time Magazine ranked Zero Hedge as 9th, in its 25 Best Financial Blogs,with nominator, Bloomberg's Paul Kedrosky, stating that "So while I don't read Zero Hedge regularly—it's too bearish, too conspiratorial and too much of an intellectual monoculture—I like knowing that it exists. Any time I'm feeling like things might just turn out O.K. on planet Economic Earth, I know where to turn to be disabused of that stupid idea."

The blog is notable beyond its conspiracy theories and pessimistic outlook on finance as a source for in-depth original research from Wall Street investment banks and institutions on securities and other financial instruments or bodies, which are sometimes picked up by the financial media.

## Funding
Daniel Ivandjiiski has been identified as the Bulgarian-born, U.S.-educated former hedge-fund trader, who was barred from the securities industry in September 2008 for earning USD$780 from an insider trade by FINRA,<sup>[FINRA](https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/4445294)</sup> as the founder of the site, and reported that "Tyler Durden" was a pseudonym for Ivandjiiski.

In a 29 April 2016 Bloomberg article "unmasking" Zero Hedge, the authors writing as "Tyler Durden" were revealed as Ivandjiiski, Tim Backshall, and Colin Lokey. Lokey, publicly revealed himself and the other two when he left the site in April 2016.Ivandjiiski confirmed the three men "had been the only Tyler Durdens on the payroll" since Lokey joined in 2015. Lokey said he was paid $6,000 per month, and received a bonus of $50,000, earning over $100,000 in 2015. According to Ivandjiiski, the blog generates revenue from online advertising.

## Scoring
The 29 April 2016 unmasking article by Bloomberg, quoted Lokey as saying: "I can't be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. It's wrong.", summarizing its political stances as "Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry=dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft."

These opinions are reflected in the ideological framing of numerous articles, with coverage of the pandemic generally praising right-leaning positions (anti-mask, concern for the economy, pro-police), with some articles claiming the 2020 pandemic to be a hoax aimed at removing President Trump.

_Editorial_ is most easily categorised as a ten as all in-house entries with are attributed to the character 'Tyler Durden.' One female site contributor, who spoke to New York magazine in an interview arranged by Ivandjiiski, said "up to 40" people could post under the "Tyler Durden" pseudonym.
