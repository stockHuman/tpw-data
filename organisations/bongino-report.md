## Overview
Bongino Report is a news aggregator similar to [Drudge](/drudgereport) in function, and another entity in Dan Bongino's [conservative media sphere](/bongino). It heavily promotes and integrates the Parler social network platform, where Dan Bongino enjoys official endorsement.

The site was started as an explicit challenger to The Drudge Report, perceived at the time of the site's inception as having _betrayed_ the right by aggregating stories unfavourable to Donald Trump.

Canadian Conservative outlet [The Post Millenial](/the-post-millenial) wrote in August of 2020:
> Bongino has been fiercely critical of Drudge. He then designed his publication to rival the Drudge Report, peeling away the latter's disaffected Trump supporters and teasing in a social media campaign that his Bongino Report would release "exclusively conservative and libertarian content."<sup>[1](https://thepostmillennial.com/bongino-report-replaces-drudge-report-and-its-liberal-drudgery)</sup>

## Funding
This site is funded by advertising. Bongino himself has additional media revenue via his podcast and partial ownership of Rumble, a platform attempting to compete with YouTube.

## Scoring
Whilst ownership is obvious, site operation and story selection is not, and the site does not disclose any information about itself. As such, it earns a `0` for editorial transparency.
