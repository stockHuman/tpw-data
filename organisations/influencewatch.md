## Overview
InfluenceWatch is a database of allegedly center-to-left-wing leaning media figures, investors, buisnesses, NGOs, and news publications that presents Wikipedia-like articles summarizing their history and activities.

## Scoring
Articles on the site have no attribution, and contributions are mediated privately by contacing the platform. The site however readily discloses it's parent organisation, which is itself a self-described right-wing enterprise.

Messaging bias is informed by performing a search for notable figures and institutions from the right and encountering either no data, or no analysis as present in the conversely very complete entries for left-leaning entitites.
