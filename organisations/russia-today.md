## Overview
RT was an ambitious public diplomacy project that was initially established to present a  positive image of Russia to the world. The organisation's content has changed considerably following the Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008.

## Funding
The Kremlin allocated US$400M in funding for the channel for the 2015-2017 budget<sup>[page 3](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RT.pdf)</sup>, and a 2013 decree signed by Putin banned cuts to state-run news media, which includes RT.

## Scoring
Article authorship on news items is normally uncredited, with Op-Eds usually featuring bylines. Of those bylines, most include a relevant bio and some links to other work or social media. RT lists the Editor-in-Chief and Managing Director in a "Management" page. This all corresponds to a editorial transparency score of `4`.

RT has promoted 9/11 Trutherism ("911 Reasons why 9/11 was (probably) an inside job" - Minor disclaimer added)<sup>[1](http://web.archive.org/web/20200810165611/https://www.rt.com/usa/nine-eleven-attack-job/)</sup>, birther conspiracy theories ("Obamaâ€™s birthplace mystery raises doubts"), Seth Rich conspiracy theories, Hillary Clinton health conspiracy theories, Bilderberg conspiracy theories, and the odd 4chan theory. RT has a poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.
