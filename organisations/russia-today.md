RT has promoted 9/11 Trutherism ("911 Reasons why 9/11 was (probably) an inside job"), birther conspiracy theories ("Obamaâ€™s birthplace mystery raises doubts"), coronavirus disinformation ("Russia Today... broadcast that hand-washing was ineffective against coronavirus", Seth Rich conspiracy theories, Hillary Clinton health conspiracy theories, Bilderberg conspiracy theories, and random-ass 4chan conspiracy theories. RT has no reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Rather, it has a reputation for falsehoods, conspiracy theories and disinfo. Snooganssnoogans (talk) 18:02, 9 May 2020 (UTC)
