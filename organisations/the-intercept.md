## Overview
The Intercept was launched in February 2014, by First Look Media, which is funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The publication gained initial attention with its report on the leak of classified NSA documents by Edward Snowden.
Subsequent reporting on illegal US government surveillance and other global _signals intelligence_ stories with particular focus on the West has established the online-only publication as a reputable source for whistleblowing on major geopolitical players.

The Intercept cites its long term mission as “to provide aggressive and independent adversarial journalism across a wide range of issues, from secrecy, criminal and civil justice abuses and civil liberties violations to media conduct, societal inequality and all forms of financial and political corruption.”

## Funding
The Intercept is a registered nonprofit, funded through online advertising and individual donations.<sup>[faq](https://theintercept.com/donor-faq/)</sup>

## Scoring
The Intercept has never failed a fact check, and uses reliable sources in their reporting. However, reporter Juan M. Thompson was fired in 2016 due to him having "fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people" according to senior editor Betsy Reed. The Intercept has retracted Thompson's stories and concluded an investigation wherein Thompson did not cooperate.

Politically, The Intercept uses loaded language favouring left causes, and is critical of both major political parties in the United States. Repeated favorable coverage was given to left-leaning challengers running against incumbent Democrats during the 2018 primaries.
