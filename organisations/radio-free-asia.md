## Overview
Founded and funded in the 1950s as an anti-communist propaganda operation, Radio Free Asia was ran by an organization called "Committee for Free Asia", with broadcasting from RCA facilities within in Manila, the Philippines, Dacca and Karachi, and Pakistan until 1961. In 1971, CIA involvement ended and all responsibilities were transferred to a presidentially appointed Board for International Broadcasting (BIB).

In 1994, RFA was operated by the United States Information Agency where it remained until the agency's cessation of broadcasting duties. It has remained active under various US state media organisations since, albeit under nominally independent control.

According to a report by the Congressional Research Service of the U.S. government, official state-controlled newspapers in China have run editorials claiming Radio Free Asia is a CIA broadcast operation, as was the case with the first Radio Free Asia.

## Funding
The current Radio Free Asia is a US-funded organization, incorporated in March 1996, and began broadcasting in September 1996. Although senators debated a name change, Richard Richter, the then president of Radio Free Asia, was instructed to change the name back from Asia-Pacific Network to Radio Free Asia, as "we must have the courage to confront tyranny, and to do so under the banner of freedom." Radio Free Asia was forced to change in part due to financial pressures from the US government, for although they operate with an independent board, their money mostly comes from the Treasury.

Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a private, nonprofit international broadcasting agency of the United States government that broadcasts and publishes online news, information, and commentary to listeners in East Asia while “advancing the goals of U.S. foreign policy.” RFA is funded by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), an independent agency of the United States government responsible for all non-military, international broadcasting sponsored by the U.S government (such as Radio Free Europe), which appoints the board of RFA. RFA distributes content in nine Asian languages for audiences in six countries. RFA is well-sourced and factual in reporting. Radio Free Asia has a very slight left leaning bias in reporting choices.

## Scoring
RFA sometimes discloses author byline, although it is usually attributed to a RFA regional service, with translators named but not linked to: _Reported by RFA’s Khmer Service.

In 1999, Catharin Dalpino of the Brookings Institution, who served in the Clinton State Department as a deputy assistant secretary deputy for human rights, called Radio Free Asia "a waste of money." "Wherever we feel there is an ideological enemy, we're going to have a Radio Free Something," she says. Dalpino said she has reviewed scripts of Radio Free Asia's broadcasts and views the station's reporting as unbalanced. "T hey lean very heavily on reports by and about dissidents in exile. It doesn't sound like reporting about what's going on in a country. Often, it reads like a textbook on democracy, which is fine, but even to an American it's rather propagandistic."
