## Overview
The Washington Post, sometimes refferred to as _WaPo_, is an American daily newspaper published in Washington, D.C. with a large national and international readership.

## Funding
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013. Since, it has been [criticized](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/04/trump-amazon-washington-post-jeff-bezos-217774/) as suffering in editorial legitimacy and independece because of Bezos' suzerainty, with a popular complaint being the lack of disclosure of Amazon or Bezos' financial interests when convering particular stories:

> "In failing to consistently inform readers of Bezos’s connection to Amazon, the Post is continuing a pattern of not disclosing its owner’s ties to companies at convenient times. Last year, as ride-hailing giant Uber faced increasing scrutiny over a series of scandals, the Post suddenly stopped disclosing that Bezos was an early Uber investor."

## Scoring
The Washington Post runs stories with emotionally loaded headlines and body content both in news and editorial items, favoring socially left, or anti-right causes. It has only endorsed Democratic Presidential candidates since 1976, including Hillary Clinton in 2016.

WaPo has published [fake news](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/report-vermont-power-grid-infiltrated-by-russian-hackers/) and [items with dubious](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-call-georgia-investigator/2021/01/09/7a55c7fa-51cf-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) [sources before](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html) with slow or half-hearted retractions. As such, it earns a `7` in sourcing.

It notably has an anti-progressive stance with regards to the Democratic party.<sup>[1](https://fair.org/home/wapo-warns-progressive-dems-they-could-win/) [2](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/bernie-sanders-washington-post-media-complaint-872349/)</sup>
