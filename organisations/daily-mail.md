## Overview
Established in 1896 by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth and Kennedy Jones, The Daily Mail is a tabloid newspaper in the UK.

## Funding
Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) operates DMG Media, which is in turn the subsidiary that operates newspapers including the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday, Metro, and (as of 2021) _New Scientist_.

The main revenue of the Daily Mail is digital advertising, print ads, and subscription fees. DMGT reported a revenue of [£1,426M](https://cdg-dmgt.com/investors/assets18/pdf/DMGT_AR18_Interactive.pdf) in 2018.

## Scoring
The Daily Mail supports the British Conservatives and right-populist parties, and right wing politicians and causes otherwise.

The Daily Mail also has been criticized by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales for publishing fake news articles and “hyped up” headlines and “mastered the art of running stories that aren’t true’”.

The Daily Mail notably publishes long, sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wording or quotes. In 2017, Wikipedia banned the Daily Mail as an ‘unreliable’ source. When it comes to sourcing information they use minimal hyperlinked sourcing as well as frequent sourcing to other Daily Mail reporting. On occasion, the Daily Mail will report on stories outside of a right-leaning perspective if the material is fit for tabloids.
