## Overview
Cop Block is a decentralized police accountability project. The organization's members and volunteers attempt to draw attention to alleged or evident police abuses that happen across the United States, and work to film police to force transparency and accountability within their ranks. However, believing that accountability will never end police brutality, the group shifted its focus to the complete abolishment of all law enforcement.

On October 11, 2018 Cop Block became 1 of 559 pages and 251 accounts purged by Facebook for allegedly engaging in spam and “coordinated inauthentic activity" by creating “sensational political content...to build an audience and drive traffic to their websites."[27] Among these were several other popular pages dedicated to police accountability and documenting police brutality, including Police the Police, Filming Cops, Cop Logic and Policing the Police, which had over 1.9 million, 1.5 million, 129,000, and 54,000 Facebook likes respectively. Cop Block had over 1.7 million likes. Police the Police and Filming Cops were also simultaneously eliminated from Twitter
