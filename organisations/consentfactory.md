## Overview
_Consent Factory_ collects the political writings of author and playwright CJ. Hopkins.

## Scoring
Hopkins is presently based in Berlin, but this site does not meaningfully engage with German politics, and is indeed focused primarily on Anglosphere politics.

Nearly all articles at the time of writing explore meta-critiques of Western ideology, intermittently referred to as _"GloboCap"_ (or _Global Capitalism_, as used frequently in [similar](/off-guardian) circles). Many articles present western neoliberalism as a coherent agent with a hidden agenda: to advance authoritarianism though the political crisis _du jour_. CJ uses highly loaded prose to advance his arguments, sometimes employing citations, self-citations, and on occasion linking to articles that do not support his theses.

Couching his material in the label "political satire" does not obfuscate the clear political messaging, and as such the above informs ratings for sourcing, conspiracy, ideological leaning and political biases. [This article](https://consentfactory.org/2021/02/23/the-vaccine-disinformation-war/) informs the pseudoscience rating.
