## Overview
Snopes is an online fact-checking and mythbusting site ran by David MIkkelson.

## Funding
In 2016, Snopes said that the entirety of its revenue was derived from advertising. However, in 2016, it also received an award of $75,000 from the James Randi Educational Foundation, an organization formed to debunk paranormal claims. In 2017, it raised approximately $700,000 from a crowd-sourced GoFundMe effort and received $100,000 from Facebook as a part of a fact-checking partnership.

## Scoring

Snopes has been frequently accused of Liberal bias or even outright collaboration. This is unsubstantiated, where the most salient claims concern single instances where negative news items are [charitably explained away](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-ossoff-warnock-checks-2000/) in favor of the Democrat party.
