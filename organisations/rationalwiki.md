## Overview

## Funding

## Scoring
RationalWiki, despite using the same platform and thus appearance of Wikipedia, does not maintain a neutral point of view, instead favoring a "snarky", sarcastic tone to lampoon _"the anti-science movement, crank ideas, medical woo, charlatans, religious and political extremists"_ (per their bio).

The size and scope of RationalWiki makes a sourcing rating unrealistic. Some articles are well-cited, despite the explicit bias for or against any given topic, whilst others completely lack sources - a problem common to wiki sites.

The editorial transparency score, given anonymous edits, corresponds to a three.
