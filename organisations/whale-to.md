## Overview
_Whale.to_ is John Scudamore's personal collection of conspiratorial and pseudoscientific writings and links. According to the about page <sup>[history](http://whale.to/b/whale_history.html)</sup>, the conspiracies presented by are personal beliefs of the author to some extent or another, even when contradictory. The site promotes new paganism as well as Sandy Hook hoax theories, 9/11 conspiracies, holocaust denial and eastern mysticism.

This site is notable as a catalogue of recent conspiracy theories and pseudoscience material from the perspective of a believer.

## Funding
According to the John Scudamore, the website is funded by user donations.

## Scoring
This site scores an automatic ten by promoting holocaust denial, but would score a ten anyway given the content. No article contains non-conspiratorial material.

John's beliefs, as described in the about, have moved further right with explorations of Holocaust denial and Jewish domination conspiracies. [Some articles](http://whale.to/b/multiculturalism_h.html) point to antisemitism and generalised anti-left propaganda, despite contradictions within others. The serverity of targeted language that biases against people outweighs the inconsistent attacks on right-wing figures and causes.<sup>[dir](http://whale.to/b/covert_q.html)</sup>
