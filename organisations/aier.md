## Overview
Per AIER, "[the organisation] conducts advanced economic research and then leverages this work to reach the broader public through accessible educational programming." It advances Austrian economic policies and laissez-faire, libertarian policies more generally through a variety of means; including academic partnerships, print books, social media, traditional journalism and clubs.<sup>[2019 Annual Report](https://www.aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AIER-AnnualReport2019.pdf)</sup>

## Funding
AIER owns [American Investment Services Inc.](https://www.americaninvestment.com/), whose private fund, valued at around $285 million in 2020, includes holdings in a wide range of fossil fuel companies incl. Chevron and ExxonMobil, along with tobacco giant Philip Morris International, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc. and many others.<sup></sup>

AIER additionally organises speaking events through the 'Bastiat Society' and academic engagements, publishes books, and produces [online video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwqnRYPcrl0).

The Bastiat Society partners with the Atlas Network, Ayn Rand Institute, Cato Institute, the State Policy Network, the Charles Koch Institute and other Koch-funded think tanks.

## Scoring
AIER Articles, books, videos and talks by affiliated members reliably promote free-market capitalism, and are thus hostile to competing left leaning theories, and interventioninst free-market theories such as advanced by John M. Keynes and Milton Friedman. It does not advocate for anarcho-capitalism outright, but some columns write favourably about it.<sup>[2](https://www.aier.org/article/stateless-in-the-walled-city-of-kowloon/)</sup> As such the governmental bias rating, based on a selection of recent articles (as of October 2020), earns a `-7`.

AIER material criticizes the American political dichotomy, generally taking time to particularly appreciate the difference between populist Republicans and the party's former free-market position.<sup>[1](https://www.aier.org/article/so-you-want-to-overthrow-the-state-ten-questions-for-aspiring-revolutionaries/)</sup> However, most articles that comment on social issues or political affiliation will write favourably of the right over the left, when relevant. Loaded laguange and hostile rhetoric is more common in their video efforts than in written articles, which seldom comment of matters outside of what can't be directly related to economics. As such, with some consistent bias against left-leaning positions, it earns a `3`.
