## Overview
OffGuardian syndicates "alt-news" from various personal blogs. It is so named by the "fact its founders had all been censored on and/or banned from the Guardian’s ‘Comment is Free’ sections."

## Funding
OffGuardian is funded through user donations, including Bitcoin.

## Scoring
The following articles have simultaneously informed pseudoscience, conspiracy and sourcing values:

[COVID19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless](https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/), published June 27, 2020 makes the claim that PCR is unfit for viral detection (the central thesis of the article is a false claim<sup>[politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/07/blog-posting/covid-19-tests-are-not-scientifically-meaningless/)</sup>) with additional misrepresentations of apparently legitimate testimony to back up other minor points.

[GloboCap Über Alles](https://off-guardian.org/2020/07/21/globocap-uber-alles/) presents emotionally loaded phrases against left-leaning causes, as well as anti-capitalism and conspiratorial rhetoric.

OffGuardian publishes content with contradictory views, yet threaded by common themes of anti-establishment, anti-government, collapse paranoia and generalised _counternarrative_ appeal. A section entitled "Outside the Overton Window" syndicates content with these themes, albeit without a unified political stance.

OffGuardian has published material that supports Russian versions of events, including:
> "There is little verifiable evidence of civilian deaths from Syrian bombing however, as confirmed by the White Helmets’ evident need to fake such deaths for their rescue videos. At the centre of the Douma hoax chemical attack were the contorted bodies of 35 women and children, whose murder for a propaganda video is certainly a war-crime."

[syria's war on self-defense](https://off-guardian.org/2020/02/28/syrias-war-of-self-defence/)

And in a September 2020 article entitled "The False Flag Poisoning of Alexei Navalny", Max Perry made the case for the poisoning being the work of the British Government, in cooperation with Western allies. <sup>[2020.09](https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/25/the-false-flag-poisoning-of-alexei-navalny/)</sup>
