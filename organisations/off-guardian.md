## Overview


## Scoring
The following articles have simultaneously informed pseudoscience, conspiracy and sourcing values:

[COVID19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless](https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/), published June 27, 2020 makes the claim that PCR is unfit for viral detection (the central thesis of the article is a false claim<sup>[politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/07/blog-posting/covid-19-tests-are-not-scientifically-meaningless/)</sup> with additional misrepresentations of apparently legitimate testimony to back up other minor points.

[GloboCap Ãœber Alles](https://off-guardian.org/2020/07/21/globocap-uber-alles/) presents emotionally loaded phrases against left-leaning causes, as well as anti-capitalism and conspiratorial rhetoric.
