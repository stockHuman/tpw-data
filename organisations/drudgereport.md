## Overview
Starting initially as a Usenet newsletter in 1995, The Drudge Report is [Matt Drudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Drudge)'s news aggregation site, that he has maintained himself since its inception, with editorial support.

The Drudge report gained initial notoriety for publishing reporting on the material that eventually became the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998.

The site aggregates content from a variety of sources including: New York Post, RT, CNBC, The Week, Vice and others. The site has generally been regarded as conservative leaning, though criticism from within the Trump-supporting right in 2019 and 2020 stemming from a change in editorial content no longer unfavourable to Trump drew that association in question. In 2019, an unconfirmed report by Rasmussen claimed that Matt Drudge had sold the site.

## Funding
The site is funded by advertising, notably earning the site approximately $3.4 million a month, or $40.8 million a year. <sup>[247](https://247wallst.com/media/2020/10/06/drudge-report-is-worth-over-100-million/)</sup>

## Scoring
Being a news aggregator, the pseudoscience, conspiracy and sourcing ratings must be derived from the material it aggregates. It should be noted that the material on Drudge is wholly curated, with each link carrying a bespoke headline written by Drudge or his editors. Drudge will on occasion publish original reporting. The material is generally coherent with a right-wing, populist stance, and as such earns a `7` on messaging.

Frequent loaded language in editorialised headlines as well as story selection earns it a `6` in social bias.

The publishing of Obama Birther conspiracies, 2017 Las Vegas shooting conspiracies as well as false reporting (sometimes retracted) earns a conspiracy rating of `2`, on account of the aggregated nature of the site and the relatively low frequency of such occurences, especially given more recent trends.
