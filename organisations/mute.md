## Overview
Mute Magazine is an online and print publication writing on the topics of new technologies and contemporary society from a left-wing perspective. Per _Mute_: "we need to critically engage with the ways in which new media also reproduce and extend capitalist social relations. Mute invites its readers and writers to consider new possibilities for resistance to hegemonies wherever they find them, from socio-economic and technical structures, to codes of representation and enunciation, to the production and articulation of psychic experience and beyond."<sup>[about](https://www.metamute.org/about-us)</sup>

Mute magazine was previously published through the Slade School of Art from 1989-1992. The present domain was registered on 2001-03-09.

## Funding
Mute is funded though print sales and government grants.

## Scoring
Mute's editorial positions are very consistently on the left. Whilst diversity exists within individual articles, overall Mute does not publish anything that does not come from a leftist perspective. As such, it scores a `10` on messaging, and `-8` on social bias, based on the framing and references used in articles.

In the aftermath of 2020's BLM summer, Mute published an article championing cars as a tool for looting so as to advance black liberation.<sup>[2020.11](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/cars-riots-black-liberation)</sup>

Some articles, primarily dealing with left-wing acedemia, are rigorously cited as if published as academic essays in their own right.<sup>[2020.01](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/capital-abandon-some-words-and-oft-inspired-jacques-camatte)</sup> Essays reflecting on current events and news media tend not to follow the same criteria, though some do.<sup>[2020.05](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/isnt-virus-its-time-machine)</sup> Note this rating reflects the content of the written, online, editorial material only.

Mute publishes an editorial masthead, but contributions in the editorial section are listed as a simple byline, without a bio or ability to find other works by the same author(s). This corresponds to an editorial rating of `4`. Though not considered, the community section corresponds to a `1`.
