## Overview
Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, or _FAIR_, is a media watchdog primarily concerned with corporate ownership of media entities, calling for the break-up of such conglomerates.

Per FAIR, _All of us who founded FAIR have media backgrounds. Our sympathies are with the working press. We do not view reporters, editors and producers as our enemy. Nor do we hunt for conspiracies. The villain we see is not a person or group, but a historical trend: the increasing concentration of the U.S. media in fewer and fewer corporate hands._

_FAIR was launched in mid-1986 at a time when the major media were bending distinctly rightward. Big media businesses were being absorbed by even bigger ones, with dangerous implications for those viewpoints already underrepresented. Well-financed right-wing groups like the misnamed Accuracy In Media ([AIM](/aim)) were harassing journalists who uncovered unpleasant truths about poverty, inequality, government corruption or U.S. military and nuclear policy."_<sup>[1](https://fair.org/extra/whats-fair/)</sup>

## Funding
FAIR is a registered non-profit funded though donations, with "grants from foundations and public charities [comprising] about 41 percent of our total operating budget." <sup>[2](https://fair.org/planned-giving/)</sup> It maintains an online merch store.

## Scoring
FAIR publishes well-cited material with minimal loaded language in headlines and article copy (ex: [UN Rebuke of US Sanctions on Venezuela Met With Stunning Silence](https://fair.org/home/un-rebuke-of-us-sanctions-on-venezuela-met-with-stunning-silence/)). Story selection slightly favors left-leaning causes, with article content generally critical of major American news organisations<sup>[1](https://fair.org/home/has-nyt-heard-of-chinas-or-russias-covid-vaccines/) [2](https://fair.org/home/media-find-heroes-in-republicans-who-oppose-trump-and-also-democracy/)</sup>, per their stated goals.
