## Overview
Also referred to as _538_, so named after the number of electors in the United States Electoral College, _FiveThirtyEight_ is an American polling aggregator covering politics and sports statistics.

## Funding
Previously a [New York Times](/new-york-times) column ran by Nate Silver, 538 was purchased by ESPN in 2013, and is therefore a property the Walt Disney Company.

The site is supported by advertising revenue, and operates under [ABC News](/abc)' network (itself also a Walt Disney property).

## Scoring
The site reliably cites sources and even hosts [open data on Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data), and provides a linked bio with every author, including the masthead.

Coverage of US election politics favors Neoliberal candidates from the Democratic Party (sometimes known as "corporate Democrats") and discounts "progressive", or left-leaning candidates.
